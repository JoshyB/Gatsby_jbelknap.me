          <h2>What I do professionally...</h2>
          <p>
            I'm an independent freelance web developer based in Ohio. I have 4
            years of experience building things on the web, and I typically work
            with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
            React.js but I also do full-stack development on occasionâ€”everything
            from designing to coding to deploying.
          </p>
          <p>Here are a few technolgies I have worked with recently:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS & SCSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>React.js</li>
            <li>GraphQL</li>
            <li>Express.js</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Version Control (Git)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>What I do for fun...</h2>
          <p>
            I, of course love to spend time with my family, be it going to
            parks, hiking, or just hanging out at home. I like to travel as
            often as I possibly can. I really enjoy seeing new places and having
            new experiences. I also very much enjoy cooking. I like trying out
            new recipes or just experimenting and coming up with my own. I like
            to code things. Before I started doing this to make money, I built
            things just for fun, and I still do.
